    <p>This pasta dish is a perfect choice for meatless Monday, and with minimal ingredients it's fast to make, too!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 (9 ounce) package refrigerated tortellini</li>
        <li> ½ cup sliced portobello mushrooms</li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li> ½ cup evaporated fat-free milk</li>
        <li> ¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li> 1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li> Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced mushrooms and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove mixture to a small bowl.</li>
        <li> Add evaporated milk to skillet and heat over medium-low heat until warm. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted. Add cooked tortellini and toss to coat. Garnish with mushroom-garlic mixture.</li>
    </ol>
