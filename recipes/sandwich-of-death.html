            Mix to combine for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li> Add a 28 ounce can of whole San Marzano tomatoes to the pan along with 7 ounces of water.
             Using a potato masher, slowly mash the tomato sauce until it's smooth.
              Mix to combine. Add 1 sprig of fresh basil. Keep at a simmer over low heat for 45-90 minutes.
               Season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li> For the meatballs, saute ½ a medium onion along with 2 cloves of freshly minced garlic.
             Once fragrant, take off heat and set aside.</li>
        <li> To a large bowl add fresh parsley and basil along with ½ cup ricotta cheese,
             ½ cup of panko bread crumbs,
              the zest of 1 lemon, 1 large egg,

                and your cooled onions and garlic. </li>
        <li> Mix everything together with your hands and then form into balls.</li>
        <li> Over a medium high heat, heat some vegetable oil and then add your meatballs and brown for about 2 minutes on each side.
             Once they are browned, finish the cooking by adding them to a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and bake at 375°F for about 20 minutes. </li>
        <li> Slice your Hoagie roll in half lengthwise and then add a layer of sauce and top that with a row of deli ham.
             Next, add your meatballs and then the other half of the sandwich bread. </li>
